### A curious person dedicated to service, life-long learning, running, and coffee.

### Service

After seeing the impact the physician I shadowed had on her underserved community, I realized the amount of opportunities this field has for serving others.

I was adopted from China, and I know that my life could have played out quite differently nad I want to pay it forward to people who might not have had the same chance as I did.

I am comitted to furthering social justice in medicine and in greater society. Racism is a public health crisis, evidenced by significantly unequal health outcomes and racial biases that affect care. For example, this AAMC article highlights disparities in how we treat pain in Black pain: [How we fail black patients in pain by Janice A. Sabin, PHD, MSW](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-we-fail-black-patients-pain)

In college, some of my most meaningful experiences were when I got to be involved in the community and try to make a positive difference. Particularly, my volunteer opportunity in an Adopt A Grandparent Program gave me memories that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. The stories I received from my adopted grandparent had so much wisdom.

Through its very nature, medicine is a career that will provide me ample opportunities to pay it forward and make a positive impact on others.

### Life-Long Learning

I commit to life-long learning, both in and out of the classroom. In medicine, offers an ever evolving body of knowledge.

In fact, creating this website involved learning how to use a new command line tool and templating system.

For other projects, I've used the Hugo Static Site Generator, but this website is created using Gatsby, which works more as a progressive web app.![img](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/static/9a172caa0d7bafa251ede1162087bded/8f6f3/home-page_fast-to-build.jpg)

I enjoy learning about science and medicine, but I also love learning about different perspectives encapsulated by humanities subjects. I have a wide range of interests, from politics, to exercise (especially running) physiology/nutrition, politics, social justice issues, sleep, memory, anatomical variation, open source, and art techniques.

Art, be it illustration, photography, design, is an awesome field that lets me combine my interests in science and the humanities. I love that there is always something new to learn and experiment with. It's a relaxing activity that allows me to express myself. I've also been able to implement my artwork in my small business, which is a website about art resources and tutorials. It also has a strong community of artists, and we learn with each other.[![img](https://i.imgur.com/H1h0xIN.jpg)](https://kalispera.xyz/portfolio/)Click on the image preview for more artwork.

### Running

Running will always be a favorite activity, as it is a healthy outlet for stress, a time to think, a time to have great conversations with friends, as well as to stay in shape.

This sport also allows me to always have a new goal. I've achieved a few milestones in my journey in running: 5K, half marathon, and the full marathon I ran in Chicago for the awesome charity, St. Jude. With the help of so many others, we raised over \$1,800 to advance children's cancer research.

### Coffee
